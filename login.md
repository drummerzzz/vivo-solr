If you have not yet created any user accounts in VIVO, you can log in as the root user that you set up in the configuration file (rootUser.emailAddress in runtime.properties). If this is your first time logging in, the password will be "rootPassword". You will be required to set a new password to complete the login process.

email: vivo_root@mydomain.edu
password: rootPassword
